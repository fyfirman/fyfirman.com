# How to Fix FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text) in React

Can you see the font is changing from `default` to the expected font? That's called **FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text)**. This happened to cause your browser rendered element before your font has loaded. It makes your website look cheap and you look like a beginner. ðŸ˜Ÿ

Be grateful because in 2021 there is already an API to solve this problem. The name is **FontFaceSet API**, you can check the [documentation here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FontFaceSet/).

Letâ€™s get started!

### #0 FYI

I am using `fontsource` to import my external font. Just because, I am using the `gatsby` framework. It doesn't matter what you use, because this method works on any framework. Including the non-react framework.

```jsx
import "@fontsource/merriweather";
```

### #1 CreateÂ `state`

```jsx
const [isReady, setIsReady] = useState(false);
```

First we create a `state` to store the state whether the website is ready to render or not.

```jsx
return isReady && <div>{/* Your component goes here */}</div>;
```

Donâ€™t forget to add a condition if the state shows itâ€™s not ready, then donâ€™t render the element.

### #2 Check & LoadÂ fonts

To check the font we use `FontFaceSet` as follows:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  document.fonts.load("12px Merriweather").then(() => setIsReady(true));
}, []);
```

`Merriweather` is fontface name, you can change that. `12px` is dummy `fontSize` to check. The following line of code is a Promise so that we can add commands when the font has been successfully loaded.

### #3 And wallaaaaaâ€¦
