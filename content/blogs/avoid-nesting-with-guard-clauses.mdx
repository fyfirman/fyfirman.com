title: Avoid Nesting with Guard Clauses
publishedAt: 2023-07-19
description: A guard clause, also known as a guard statement or early return, is a programming construct used to improve code readability and maintainability by handling exceptional or undesirable cases upfront. It is a conditional statement placed at the beginning of a function or method, which checks for certain conditions and exits early if those conditions are met, effectively guarding the rest of the code from executing unnecessarily.
