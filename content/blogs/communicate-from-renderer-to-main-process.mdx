## Introduction

Electron, a cross-platform desktop application framework, employs a clear separation between the main process and renderer processes. Efficient communication from the renderer to the main process is crucial for tasks requiring access to system-level resources or native APIs. This time we will learn how to communicate from renderer to main process.

## IPC Renderer

The `ipcRenderer` module is an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter). It provides a few methods so you can send synchronous and asynchronous messages from the render process (web page) to the main process. You can also receive replies from the main process.

## Tutorial - One Way Communication

To fire a one-way IPC message from a renderer process to the main process, you can use the `ipcRenderer.send` API to send a message that is then received by the `ipcMain.on` API.

For this time, we will use it to trigger the main process to change the tray icon as the renderer process start the productivity tracker.

### Renderer process code

As mentioned before, renderer process would use `ipcRenderer.send` to send any data to main process. For example like these code:

```tsx
import Reactfrom "react";
import { ipcRenderer } from "electron";

const Productivity = () => {

  const start = () => {
    ipcRenderer.send("productivity-changed", {
      active: true,
			startedAt: new Date()
    })
  }

	const stop = () => {
    ipcRenderer.send("productivity-changed", {
      active: false
    })
  }

  return (
    ...
  )
}
```

The first parameter is _channel name_ and the second parameter is the data we’d like to send.

### Main process code

To receive it we could `[ipcMain.on](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/ipc-main)` API. We could put this code in the `background.ts` file or something similar to your project:

```tsx
interface ProductivityChangeEvent {
  active: boolean;
  startedAt?: Date;
}

ipcMain.on("productivity-changed", (event, payload: ProductivityChangeEvent) => {
  if (payload.active) {
    changeTrayIcon(payload.startedAt);
  } else {
    changeToDefault();
  }
});
```

## Result

With my secret recipe, the final result would like these:
![Icon changing and showing a timer as user start record the productivity](../src/assets/images/blog-content/communicate-from-renderer-to-main-process/result.gif)
